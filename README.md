 I'm a Software Developer and ML enthusiast pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and am interested in a variety of technologies and topics. I enjoy learning about new technology and applying them to real-world situations.
    
Aside from that, I enjoy blogging, mentoring newcomers, and building something from what I've learned. Bullet journaling has recently sparked my interest. I'm a big productivity and minimalism freak, and I'm constantly reading up on or trying out productivity hacks in an attempt to live a more balanced and thoughtful life. If you have any questions about technology, I'm pleased to assist you.

I'm a problem solver at heart, highly teachable and ready to acquire new abilities, enjoyable to work with, have a strong work ethic, and, most importantly, I'm incredibly curious and ask a lot of questions!
